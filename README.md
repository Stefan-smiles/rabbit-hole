Todays accomplishments have been few but they are monumental to the project. They include:-
- Fixing the api call so as not to crash computers repeatedly
- ensuring and updating the clerk Auth and the middle ware to go with it
- passionately discussing the wireframe and the figma and where to go fromm that.
